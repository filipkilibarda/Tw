My solution to the Twitter Puddle Problem as found on [here](http://puzzles.bostonpython.com/puddle.html).

Problem Description
----
You're given a list of values, e.g., `[0,1,2,1,1,2,3]`. Now imagine the magnitude of each value corresponds to the height of a 2D surface.

And here's one using a list with 1000 elements.

![Big example with no puddle](/big_no_puddle.png?raw=true)

Now imagine that a lot of 2D rain falls on this surface and pools up in some area.
